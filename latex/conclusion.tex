\chapter{Conclusions}

We have presented a simple system to continuously monitor the volume of drinking water passing
through an analog water meter upstream of a village located in a rural environment.
The embedded part of the system is powered by a small off-grid photovoltaic installation and
has to face intermittent and poor GSM signal coverage.
We have designed the system as a set of encapsulated hardware modules, inspired by common software engineering
techniques.
We plan to improve many of these modules based on their performance during production.
The data we accumulate during operation (battery voltage, solar production,
optical sensor output voltage range) will be a valuable help.

We hope to encourage others to experiment with simple environmental sensors like the one discussed in
this document.
