\subsection{Bus Isolation Module (BI)}

The Bus Isolation Module (BI) allows the slave to interconnect its GPIO pins with equivalent pins of the \mu M module.
These pins are not designed to support voltages > 0 when the microcontroller is powered off.
Since the slave microcontroller
is powered on only during the transmission phase, the pins configured for I2C would effectively be back-powered via
the internal ESD protection diodes.

\subsubsection*{Specification}

The switch must have the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item low power: this excludes mechanical switches like reed relays
    \item bidirectional
    \item 3.3V logic compatible
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Implementation}
