\subsection{Slave Switch Module (SS)}
\label{sec:SS}


The Slave Switch Module (SS) controls the power supply to the Slave Module (SL).
As explained previously in section \ref{sec:Too}, the slave is powered only during transmission in order
to reduce energy consumption mainly due to the relatively high standby current of the radio module.

\subsubsection*{Requirements}


The load switch must be able to switch the maximum current for both master and slave.
The maximum current is determined by the GMS module on the slave.
We expect the maximum to not exceed \SI{1}{\A}.

\subsubsection*{Implementation}
