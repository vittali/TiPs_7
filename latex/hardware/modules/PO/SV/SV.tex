\subsection{Scale V\textsubscript{batt}  Module (SV) }
\label{sec:SV}

The Scale V\textsubscript{batt} Module (SV) scales the battery voltage to make it compatible with
the operation voltage of  \mu M (\SI{3.3}{\volt}).


\subsubsection{Requirements}

The battery voltage  \cb{net}{.B} must be scaled such that the maximum value is close to
the upper input voltage limit of SV.
We suppose that the maximum voltage of a one-cell LiPo battery does not exceed  \SI{4.1}{\V}.
Let us recall that SV must operate from \SI{2.5}{\volt} which is lower than the minimum battery voltage.
There is some debate on how low LiPo batteries can be discharged. Some argue that \SI{2.5}{\V}
can be set a lower threshold. We have decided to not got beyond \SI{3}{\V}
until we have carried out our own measurements with our
batteries.



\subsubsection{Implementation}
\label{sss:svi}

We choose $U_1$ with an input common mode range of \SI{\pm100}{\milli\volt} beyond rail.
That means we can map the maximum battery voltage
to the supply rail of the op amp (\SI{2.5}{\volt}) while still keeping some margin. \par


The scale coefficient is thus $k = \frac{\si{2.5}{V}}{\si{4.1}{V}} = 0.61$.
I choose $R_1 = \SI{129}{\kilo\ohm}, R_1 = \SI{200}{\kilo\ohm}, k = 0.645$.
The maximum voltage at the non-inverting input of the buffer is therefore
$V_{max} = 0.645 \cdot\SI{4.1}{\V}  = \SI{2.64}{\V}$.
